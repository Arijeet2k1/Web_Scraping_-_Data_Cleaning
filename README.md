## Project Summary
In this project, I focused on extracting data from AmbitionBox, a website that provides detailed information about corporate companies. To automate and facilitate the web scraping process, I utilized Selenium and BeautifulSoup, two powerful tools for web automation and data extraction.

üîÑ Recognizing the potential strain on computational resources, I divided the scraping task into six manageable sets. This approach not only optimized performance but also ensured the smooth and efficient execution of the scraping process.

üìä The project resulted in a dataset containing more than 6000 rows, offering a substantial amount of information for analysis.

üßπ After successfully collecting the data, I embarked on a thorough data cleaning and transformation phase. The raw data was meticulously processed to eliminate inconsistencies, errors, and irrelevant information. The result was a clean, well-structured dataset that was easy to interpret and ready for further analysis or visualization.

‚ú® This project highlights my proficiency in web scraping, data cleaning, and data transformation, demonstrating my ability to handle large datasets and extract valuable insights from complex data sources.
